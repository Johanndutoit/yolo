# YOLO

Small extesnion that replaces your "newtab" page and shows you the amount of time in days you've been alive every time you go to open a new tab. 

I like to write down the incremented number of the days I've been alive every morning in my journal, this is the digital version that allows you to have a look at the number every time you head to open a new tab. 

A practice in mindfulness on the amount of finite time we all really have.
